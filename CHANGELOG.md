## Unreleased

## [0.15.3] - 2025-01-17

Special Mipha's Grace beta release edition

**Added**

- Multiple language localization! Currently supported languages are: English,
  Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Simplified Chinese. Spanish and Russian
  are on the way.
  - Looking for translators to translate: Japanese, Korean

**Changed**

- When a mod is installed in the wrong mode (i.e. a WiiU mod in Switch mode or
  a Switch mod in WiiU mode) the error message will now be more straightforward
- When installing a mod with no metadata, the message will be more clear, and the
  archive name will be put in the mod name field by default

**Fixed**

- Fixed a crash that could occur if you loaded a profile that you had duplicated,
  and hadn't restarted ukmm since you'd done that duplication
- Fixed an error with installing bnp's that had deepmerge logs so large that they
  had to be stored as text (looking at you, Miss Graceful Fish...)

## [0.15.2] - 2025-01-02

**Fixed**

- Fixed Cemu settings importer on Linux
- Fixed Copy mode deployment sometimes attempting to use file copier to copy folders

## [0.15.1] - 2024-12-01

**Added**

- Added Deploy Layout settings option, to give more control over deploy output location
- Added extra context to various BNP conversion errors
- Added option to install unpacked loose file mods via rules.txt

**Changed**

- Reworked RSTB calculation, for more efficient file sizes and fewer panic moons
- Reworked deployment, to better support Switch emulators

  behind a bunch of useless links or files when the effective output location changes
- Updated tooltip for deploy method, to give more clarity inside the app
- Enabled vertical scrolling in package dependency window, for long mod lists

**Fixed**

- Fixed mods that include multiple occurrences of the same option in their bnp
  throwing errors on trying to add those options to the UKMM zip

  repeatedly dying in one of the DLC shrines

- Fixed various (but not all) errors when importing improperly-made BCML mods,
  related to mod authors adding diff logs for files with no vanilla counterpart

- Fixed a rare bug where a mod might not be properly marked for merging
- Fixed a bug where some mods that were part of a profile could not be reinstalled
  after deleting that profile
- Fixed Cemu settings import
- Fixed a bug where mods with text changes may not apply those changes, depending
  on what language was chosen in the settings and what languages other mods contained
- Fixed a bug where a different language than the one chosen in the settings would
  be used for the final merge, when mods contained too many languages

## [0.15.0] - 2024-08-29

This release is fairly significant and includes *multiple breaking changes* to
the UKMM mod format. This means there is a *high likehood* that you will need to
reinstall and/or repackage existing UKMM mods to avoid errors. Ideally, this
should be the last breaking release before stabilizaiton.

**Added**

- Added support for new Cemu config paths
- Experimental support for arm64 macOS
- Added support for complex emulator command lines

**Changed**

- Switched to symlink deployment by default for Cemu
- Minor performance improvements

**Fixed**

- Fixed settings refresh after BCML migration
- Fixed broken symlink on switching profiles
- Fixed issues with language differences in text merging
- Fixed issues with StatusEffectList and LevelSensor mergers. **This is a
  breaking change which requires reinstalling mods which modify StatusEffectList
  or LevelSensor.**
- Reverted msyt version to fix BNP compatibility. **This is a reversion of an
  unintentional breaking change in the last release. It will require
  reinstalling mods which modify game texts.**

**Removed**

- Removed merging for actor recipes (`.brecipe`). Diffs will be stored whole and
  merging will simply overwrite with the highest priority. **This is a breaking
  change which requires reinstalling all mods which modify recipe files.**

## [0.13.0] - 2024-07-28

**Added**

- Added full GameBanana 1-click and "open mod with UKMM" support
- Added Refresh button to file picker
- Added specific error about mods made with old roead versions

**Fixed**

- Fixed crash when reopening tabs closed by their buttons
- Fixed rare race condition with mod packaging

**Removed**

- Removed everything related to the mod editor tool, which will probably never
  be finished

## [0.12.1] - 2024-07-04

**Added**

- Added `cargo dist` integration to provide simpler install and update methods

**Fixed**

- Restored missing Package button to Window menu
- Fixed option descriptions not showing on multiple choice
- Fixed misidentification of Switch BNPs with a `rules.txt` as Wii U mods


## [0.12.0]

**Added**

- Added experimental "binary override," as-is storage of technically invalid
  resources for mods which work despite minor "errors"

**Changed**

- Completely reworked logger using `egui_logger`, hopefully more performant and
  maintainable
- Switched some `Arc`s to `Rc`s where possible

## [0.11.1]

**Changed**

- Stopped caching open directory contents so the file picker is accurate after
  the app restarts

**Fixed**

- Fixed serious issues with reinflating BNPs with options
- Fixed parsing numeric strings in BCML 2.*x* `deepmerge.yml` files

## [0.11.0]

**Added**

- Added update mod button for developers
- Added GUI error message for startup panics

**Changed**

- Switched back from a custom fork of egui to the latest official version.
  This brings some minor unwanted UI changes, but nothing, I think, that
  affects anything functionally.

**Fixed**

- Added mod API versioning to better handle format changes across versions

**Changed**

- **Breaking change**: Updated to the newest version of roead, which supports
  BYML versions 5-7. This means *all mods that edit BYML files* may need to be
  reinstalled, which is perhaps a majority of mods. (The good news is this will
  make TOTK support easier to add in the future.)
- Updated to work on the stable Rust compiler, nightly no longer required.

**Fixed**

- Fixed "no base or DLC content folder" on some Switch mods
- Fixed panic parsing map logs with deletions in BNPs
- Fixed weird gamedata flag issue on some BNPs
